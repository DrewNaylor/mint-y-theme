Mint-Y-Tweaked
==============

Mint-Y-Tweaked is a forked version of the Mint-Y theme. This fork, mostly updated by Drew Naylor, has a few modifications, as shown below: <br>
- The "undershoot" and "overshoot" effects have been hidden.
  - Overshoot shows up when you scroll up when there's no more area left, just like Android.
  - Undershoot appears if you can scroll to see more content in a scroll area.

Editing
=======

Do not make modifications to the theme directly in the usr/share/themes directory. These are automatically generated from the files located in the src/ directory. Each subdirectory contains its own individual instructions on how to edit. Once edits are made you can generate the final themes by running the build-themes.py script.
